# Should you use react?

* List the types of problems that React solves

* You can use react for _almost anything_ BUT there are often better tools depending on what you are trying to do

* What would you not use react for?
  * Simple static content websites*
    * No interactivity
* Things react does well
  * Client side interactivity
    * Dynamic dependent drop downs
    * Enhanced form validation
      * Error messages and error states on inputs
    * Drag and Drop
  * Component based architecture

If you do not need JavaScript on a web page to begin with, you _probably_ don't need React.
  * Static Content Websites / HTML + CSS

React helps us create declarative and reusable UI pieces called components.

If you have reached the point in your website development, where you have many helper and utility functions to do common / repeated work, you could probably benefit from React.
