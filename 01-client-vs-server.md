# Know where your code is running...

* The difference between client and server
* React is a client side library _first_
  * There are ways to run it on a server like with Next.js
  * Most of the time your React code is running on the Client (Web Browser)
* Environment Variables
  * .env
    * In client side code is used for configuration
      * Prevents hard coding things
      * Prevents committing certain things to git
        * With .gitignore
      * NOT for hiding secrets
